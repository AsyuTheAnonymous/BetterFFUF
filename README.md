"BetterFFUF represents a significant enhancement to the widely used FFUF tool, specially designed to streamline the process of API and subdomain fuzzing. It was conceived to address the common frustration of manually specifying lengthy command-line arguments for FFUF. For example, having to repeatedly type a command like 'ffuf -u https://www.google.com/FUZZ -w /home/user/documents/wordlist/common.txt -p 1 -fc 200' can be cumbersome and time-consuming. While some users rely on their keyboard's up arrow to access previous commands, this approach may not be accessible to all individuals.

BetterFFUF simplifies this process by providing a more user-friendly and efficient way to perform fuzzing. It offers a looping mechanism, allowing users to initiate the process once and subsequently iterate through fuzzing tasks without the need to recall the entire command. Exiting the program is made straightforward by simply using Ctrl + C, adding to the ease and convenience of the tool.

Usage:

Navigate to the BetterFFUF directory using the command line by running 'cd path/to/BetterFFUF'.
Launch the program by entering 'python3 BetterFFUF.py'.
The program will start, and you are ready to begin fuzzing. Please ensure that FFUF is installed on your system for BetterFFUF to function seamlessly."
